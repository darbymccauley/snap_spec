Control code for the UC Berkeley Leuschner Radio Observatory spectrometer.

Updates from previous spectrometer:
  - Upgrading control code from Python 2 to Python 3
  - Updating spectrometer from ROACH to SNAP
  - Upgrading to dependency on casperfpga
  - Building a correlator that works in the same way as the spectrometer
